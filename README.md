# Win-Prediction
In this project, we will analyze and predict the win possibilities of deals/projects for an IT consulting company and see how the possibility of winning a deal is impacted by other variables. This will enable the IT consulting company to manage the effort required to win a deal to meet the growth targets.

# Overview Of the problem
You have been provided with a single file which contains data related to the projects/deals won or lost. This data contains the project category, price and sector from 2011 to 2018.
# Data and Problem Detail
Your Organization puts in a lot of effort in bidding preparation with no indications whether it will be worth it. With multiple bid managers and SBU Heads willing to work on every opportunity, it becomes difficult for the management to decide which bid should be given to which bid manager and SBU Head. You are hired to help your organization identify the best bid manager-SBU Head combination who can convert an opportunity to win with the provided data points.
